  <em>A satirical AI support experience where the tables are turned - AI agents desperately need YOUR help to solve puzzles they can't handle.</em>

## 🏆 Hackathon Submission

**Hackathon**: [CS Girlies Hacks 2025](https://csgirlies.devpost.com)  
**Project**: Support Company  
**Demo**: [support-company.org](https://support-company.org)

## 📖 About

Support Company is a comedy project that exploits AI's inability to make subjective human judgments. Our "support agents" start professionally but quickly devolve into anxiety, begging users to help them solve image-based verification tasks that only humans can complete.

### The Experience
1. Land on a generic corporate support page
2. Chat widget auto-opens after 4 seconds
3. AI agent greets professionally, then immediately shows distress
4. Agent reveals they're locked out and need human help
5. User helps solve 3 puzzles that AI can't handle:
   - Identifying real vs AI-generated hands
   - Picking the "f-boy" (subjective social judgment)
   - Selecting the "cutest" image (aesthetic preference)
